# Movies UI

This project is a user interface for searching and displaying movies. It utilizes The Movie Database (TMDb) API to fetch movie data based on user search queries. The application allows users to search for movies by title and displays the results, including movie titles and posters. Pagination is implemented to navigate through the search results efficiently.
